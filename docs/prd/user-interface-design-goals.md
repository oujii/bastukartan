# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The website should feel like a premium, trustworthy, and highly efficient utility. The user experience must be fast, intuitive, and map-centric. For tourists, it should feel welcoming and easy to navigate. For locals, it should be a powerful tool they can rely on. The design should be clean, uncluttered, and perform flawlessly on mobile devices.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Map-First Discovery:** The primary way users will explore saunas is through an interactive map that updates in real-time as filters are applied. A toggleable list view will be available as a secondary option.
* **Filter-Driven Workflow:** Finding the perfect sauna will be driven by a powerful and easy-to-use set of filters based on our defined data points (e.g., Drop-in, Lakeside, Wood-fired).
* **"One-Click to Value":** The "Sauna Now" feature will be a central, immediately accessible button on the main screen, providing instant value to users.

## Core Screens and Views
This is a conceptual list of the main "pages" or views the user will interact with for the MVP:
* **Home/Search View:** The main page featuring the map, filters, search bar, and the "Sauna Now" button.
* **Sauna Detail View:** A dedicated page for each sauna, displaying all its information clearly.
* **Submit Rating Form:** A simple modal or page for users to leave a star rating.
* **Suggest a Sauna Form:** A page where users can submit new, unlisted saunas.
* **Report Incorrect Info Form:** A modal activated from the detail page.
* **Login / User Profile View:** A minimal page for users to see their past ratings.

## Accessibility
We will target **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** as our standard. This ensures the site is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities, which is crucial for a public-facing website.

## Branding
A "clean, modern, Scandinavian" aesthetic is recommended. The color palette should feel both warm (like a sauna) and cool (like a Swedish lake), with a clean, highly-readable font.

## Target Device and Platforms
This will be a **mobile-first responsive web application**. It must function perfectly on all modern browsers and devices, from a small smartphone screen to a large desktop monitor, with a particular focus on fast performance for on-the-go mobile users.
