# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* To create the most comprehensive, accurate, and user-friendly directory of all saunas in the Stockholm area.
* To serve the distinct needs of both international tourists looking for unique experiences and local residents seeking wellness options.
* To become the top-ranking website on search engines (SEO) for "sauna in Stockholm" and related queries.
* To deliver a unique "Sauna Now" feature that allows users to instantly find available drop-in saunas nearby.
* To build a strong foundation (brand and technical) for future expansion into other cities and for introducing a booking system in a later phase.

## Background Context

The wellness market is a significant and growing trend, yet there is no single, high-quality resource dedicated to discovering saunas in Stockholm. Information is currently scattered across various spa websites, gym pages, blogs, and articles, making it difficult for users to compare options and find what they need.

This project aims to solve that problem by creating a centralized directory. The core value is to aggregate and present detailed, structured information—including sauna types, heat sources, pricing, booking rules, setting (lakeside vs. city), and opening hours—in a consistent and easily searchable format. The initial launch (MVP) will focus exclusively on the Stockholm market to ensure data quality and build a strong local brand before any potential expansion. A key part of the strategy is a dual-language approach (Swedish and English) to effectively serve both locals and tourists from day one.
