# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Setup

## Status: Review

## Story

- **Setup Commands**: git clone, npm install, create .env.local with Supabase keys
- **Dev Commands**: npm run dev, npm test, npm run lint

[Source: docs/architecture.md#coding-standards]
- **Shared Types**: Define in packages/types and import
- **Environment Variables**: Access process.env only through dedicated config module
- **UI Components**: General components in packages/ui, page-specific in apps/web/components

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest Integration Test: location: `/tests/setup/project-initialization.spec.ts`
- [ ] Manual verification of deployment pipeline

Manual Test Steps:
- Verify npm run dev starts the development server successfully
- Confirm Vercel deployment creates preview URL for PR
- Test Supabase connection by running basic query
- Validate all environment variables are properly configured

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: Claude Sonnet 4 (Augment Agent)

### Debug Log References

No debug log entries required for this story.

### Completion Notes List

**Manual Setup Required**: Tasks 3 and 4 require manual external service setup:
- **Vercel**: User must connect GitHub repository to Vercel and configure environment variables
- **Supabase**: User must create Supabase project in eu-central-1 region and obtain API keys
- **Environment**: User must copy .env.example to .env.local and fill in actual values

**Technical Foundation Complete**: All code structure, configurations, and templates are in place for immediate development start once external services are configured.
