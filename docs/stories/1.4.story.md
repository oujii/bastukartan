# Story 1.4: Sauna Detail Page

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a user
- I want to click on a sauna from the map or list and be taken to a dedicated page
- so that I can view all of its detailed information

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Clicking a map pin or a list item navigates to a unique URL for that sauna (e.g., `/sauna/hellasgarden`).
2. The detail page fetches and displays all information for the selected sauna.
3. All information is presented in a clean, readable layout.
4. The page includes a "Back to Directory" link.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3: Home page with map and list view is complete. API endpoint /api/saunas returns all saunas. Map and SaunaList components are ready for navigation integration. All 10 seeded saunas available with complete data.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture.md#security-and-performance]
**Performance Strategy**: Leverage Next.js's Static Site Generation (SSG) for detail pages and Vercel's Edge Caching for API routes.

[Source: docs/architecture.md#unified-project-structure]
**File Locations**:
- **Dynamic Routes**: apps/web/src/app/sauna/[slug]/
- **API Routes**: apps/web/src/app/api/saunas/[id]/
- **Components**: apps/web/src/components/
- **Types**: packages/types/ (Sauna interface available)

[Source: docs/architecture.md#coding-standards]
**Technical Constraints**:
- **Repository Pattern**: Use SaunaRepository.getSaunaById, no direct Supabase client in UI
- **Component Structure**: Page-specific components in apps/web/components
- **Environment Variables**: Access through packages/config module
- **Shared Types**: Import Sauna type from packages/types

[Source: docs/architecture.md#data-models]
**Available Sauna Data**:
- **Basic Info**: name, address, setting, booking_type
- **Operational**: opening_hours (JSONB), pricing_details, phone, website, booking_url
- **Features**: heat_sources[], sauna_types[], has_lake_access, amenities[], swimsuit_policy
- **Social**: avg_rating, review_count (for future features)

[Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]
**Frontend Technologies**:
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.3 with App Router and dynamic routes
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.4.5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.3
- **Performance**: Static Site Generation with ISR

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest Integration Test: location: `/tests/components/sauna-detail.spec.ts`
- [ ] E2E Test: location: `/tests/e2e/sauna-detail-navigation.spec.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
- Click sauna from map and verify navigation to detail page
- Click sauna from list and verify navigation to detail page
- Verify all sauna information displays correctly on detail page
- Test "Back to Directory" navigation link
- Validate responsive design on mobile and desktop
- Check page titles and meta descriptions
- Test direct URL access to sauna detail pages

### Completion Notes List

**Slug Generation Strategy**: Implemented robust slug generation with Swedish character normalization (å→a, ä→a, ö→o) and flexible matching algorithm. This handles Swedish sauna names properly while creating SEO-friendly URLs.

**Server-Side Data Fetching**: Fixed SSR implementation to use SaunaRepository directly instead of API calls during server-side rendering. This ensures reliable page generation and better performance.

**API Architecture**: Created dual API approach:
- **/api/saunas/[id]**: Direct ID lookup for programmatic access
- **/api/saunas/slug/[slug]**: Slug-based lookup for URL routing with fuzzy matching

**Static Site Generation**: Implemented full SSG with generateStaticParams for all sauna pages. Pages are pre-generated at build time for optimal performance and SEO.

**Navigation Integration**: Successfully updated Map and SaunaList components with navigation links. Map popups include "View Details" links, and sauna cards are fully clickable.

**Comprehensive Detail Pages**: Each sauna page displays all available information including opening hours, pricing, amenities, contact details, and booking information with responsive design.

**Ready for Next Story**: Detail pages are complete and ready for Story 1.5 (Basic Site Layout & Navigation). The foundation supports consistent header/footer components across all pages.
