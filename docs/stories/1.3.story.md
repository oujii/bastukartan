# Story 1.3: Home Page with Map & List View

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a user
- I want to see all listed saunas on an interactive map and in a simple list on the home page
- so that I can get an overview of my options in Stockholm

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The home page successfully fetches all sauna records from the Supabase database.
2. An interactive map displays a pin for the location of each sauna.
3. A scrollable list below the map displays the name and neighborhood of each sauna.
4. The page is responsive and displays cleanly on both desktop and mobile.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: Database schema is complete with SaunaRepository providing abstracted data access. Migration and seeding scripts are ready. Database contains 10 diverse Stockholm saunas for testing.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture.md#core-workflows]
**Home Page Workflow**: Server-side rendering with Next.js fetching sauna data from Supabase, then serving pre-rendered HTML with data to browser.

[Source: docs/architecture.md#external-apis]
**Map Integration**: Mapbox API for interactive maps and geocoding
- **Documentation**: https://docs.mapbox.com/
- **Authentication**: Requires public access token
- **Environment**: NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN

[Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]
**Frontend Technologies**:
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.3 with React 18.3.1
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.4.5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.3
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

[Source: docs/architecture.md#coding-standards]
**Technical Constraints**:
- **Repository Pattern**: Use SaunaRepository, no direct Supabase client in UI
- **Component Structure**: Page-specific components in apps/web/components
- **Environment Variables**: Access through packages/config module
- **Shared Types**: Import from packages/types

[Source: docs/architecture.md#unified-project-structure]
**File Locations**:
- **API Routes**: apps/web/src/app/api/
- **Components**: apps/web/src/components/
- **Pages**: apps/web/src/app/
- **Types**: packages/types/ (already defined)

[Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]
**Testing Requirements**:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest & React Testing Library for components
- **Integration Tests**: Component and API interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical user flows

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest Integration Test: location: `/tests/components/home-page.spec.ts`
- [ ] E2E Test: location: `/tests/e2e/home-page.spec.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
- Verify home page loads and displays sauna data
- Confirm map renders with correct pins for all saunas
- Test list view shows sauna names and addresses
- Validate responsive design on mobile and desktop
- Check loading states and error handling

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used: Claude Sonnet 4 (Augment Agent)

### Debug Log References

No debug log entries required for this story.

### Completion Notes List

**Map Coordinates Implementation**: Due to the lack of geocoded coordinates in the database, implemented approximate coordinate mapping based on Stockholm districts and neighborhoods. This provides functional map display but could be enhanced with proper geocoding in future stories.

**Mapbox Configuration**: Map component gracefully handles missing Mapbox access token with clear error messaging. The map centers on Stockholm (18.0686, 59.3293) and uses Mapbox Streets style.

**Component Architecture**:
- **Map Component**: Client-side component with proper loading states and error handling
- **SaunaList Component**: Includes loading skeletons, empty states, and accessibility features
- **Home Page**: Responsive layout with comprehensive error handling and retry functionality

**API Integration**: Successfully implemented /api/saunas endpoint using SaunaRepository pattern. API returns all 10 seeded saunas with proper error handling.

**Ready for Next Story**: Home page is fully functional and ready for Story 1.4 (Sauna Detail Pages). The foundation supports navigation to individual sauna pages.
